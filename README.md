Created with love in Poland.

## Why AGPL license and not XXX 
We believe that we have got so many great things from our community like
compilers, languages, and we get it for free. No strings attached. Free as in beer.
But, the world is not so humble and many vendors creating software lock you up with
various licenses, disallowing you to contribute, improve or in other way change your software.
They haunt you with "licenses" which are just a way to impose
restrictions on how you deal with software. Software is like an art.
You shall be able to reproduce it, remix, do what you want with the software. So we require you
to allow your users to see what changes have you made with KnowledgeCat, give back your improvements, edits,
or even maybe deletions - if you find some functions unnecessary.

We want to give back to community. And seek the community to help us out.
